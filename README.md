## Pre-selection for test automation mentoring participation: Java
### Task 1
Design object model for given domain.

Please demonstrate usage of:
* Classes(abstract classes - if applicable)
* Interfaces
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Collection framework

Each class, method and variable should have meaningful name and purpose. You need to determine
which classes are required to solve the task. Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense.
Classes should be grouped into corresponding packages. Work with console should be minimized (only
required data for input, output correspond the info in task). It is expected that you will choose certain
domain from the list below, define classes hierarchy for that domain and implement it using OOP
(inheritance or implementing interfaces). Each class should have methods and fields defined by you.
Your program should create objects of different types in chosen domain and combine them into
collection (use collections framework). Next, will be required to process data of that collection by
certain rules

### Domain option
**Airline.** Define airplanes hierarchy. Create airline. Calculate total capacity and load capacity.
Sort company's airplanes by predefined criteria (define criteria by yourself). Find airplane
which will match predefined criteria (you could define one or several criteria).

### Task 2
For the object model implemented in task 1, it is needed to design custom exception classes and
implement handling of possible exceptional situations. For example, there is no element that meets
required criteria in the collection, impossible to delete an element etc. Leave your explanation in
commented blocks of your exception class. Create at least 3 custom exceptions and use 5 built-in
exceptions minimum.
